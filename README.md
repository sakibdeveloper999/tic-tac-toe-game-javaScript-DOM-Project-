## ⚙️ How the Game Works

1. Player **X** starts the game.
2. Click on any empty cell to make a move.
3. The **AI Bot (O)** responds automatically.
4. The game checks for:

   * Win condition
   * Draw condition
5. A popup displays the result.
6. Click **Continue** to play the next round.
7. Click **Restart Game** to reset the board.

## 🧠 AI Bot Strategy

The bot follows a simple but effective decision‑making process:

1. Try to **win** if a winning move exists
2. **Block** the player if they are about to win
3. Take the **center cell** if available
4. Choose a **random available cell**

This provides a balanced difficulty level while keeping the logic readable.
